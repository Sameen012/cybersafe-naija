      <p>
        Nigerians lose billions of naira annually to social engineering, fake grant disbursements, and rogue
        investment rooms. Our mission is to make cybersecurity literacy accessible through stories, simulators,
        and playbooks that resemble the real tactics targeting local communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform is community-driven: verified admins publish quick reads while everyday users submit scam
        numbers, screenshots, and voice notes. Together, we create faster warnings that travel beyond the
        scammers.
